### Welcome to my GitHub. If you're here, you may already know that I love snowboarding. In case you didn't... well, now you know. I also love a couple of other things and coding became my latest love. 

## Briefly about me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an open-source project called CSI Linux (https://csilinux.com/), which is a Linux distribution for Digital Forensics and Incident Response. I re-designed and developed the website. It was built in MERN Stack and it has a mobile responsive design. Other functionalities are currently being developed and will be added soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in-depth styling technologies. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on frontend development.
